OpenAI API for Santa answering children's letter

Takes a scanned image of a written letter, stores as text, fed to OpenAI API for response back from Santa, then presented in cursive written letter from Santa.

Pacifico-Regular.ttf is font suggested by ChatGPT as cursive font that possibly replicates Santa's handwriting  
santa_scrubbed.py is the Python code largely generated by ChatGPT through a series of questions that I posed
